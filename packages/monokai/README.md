# Monokai Theme

A professional JupyterLab theme with hand-picked & bold colors for JupyterLab. The theme is heavily inspired by the [Pantone colour of the year 2018](https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2018) and the Outrun aesthetics. However, colors are on the pastel side to help provide contrast and highlight what is essential. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances.
